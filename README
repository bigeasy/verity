PURPOSE

This is the patchwork of code that creates a Verity Grid. The Verity Grid is a
semi-automatic cross-platform web user interface testing apparatus.

Here's how Verity works:

 * Verity Grid runs a Node.js server from an OS X or Linux host, and tests web
   applications on any platform running in IE 6/9, Firefox, Chrome, Safari
   or Opera.
 * Verity Grid uses a minimal Greasemonkey script to automate page navigateion
   and ensure that a stalled browser can find its way back to home base 
 * A Verity Report Server issues test jobs to web browsers that visit the page
   with the Greasemonkey script installed and configured for that particular
   test server.
 * Verity Grid extends QUnit so that your QUnit tests can report their outcomes
   to the Verity Report Server.
 * Verity works with FuncUnit/Syn so that you have a JavaScript based automation
   langauge to write your tests in JavaScript, a language that you must already
   be familair with, if you're building web applications.

How do you build a Verity Grid? Use VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels to run guest
operating systems. Install Greasemonkey and the Verity Launcher on the brower
and navigate to your Verity Report Server. Now, leave it alone. The browser will
accept jobs, run them, and return home to the Verity Report Server.

Verity is a recipe with apparatus for OS X and Linux that simplifies the
necessary evil of  testing Interent Explorer, simplifies cross-platform testing.

Verity is meant to run continuously, as you develop, instead of at check in. It
is part of your development enviornment, so you are constantly aware of the
health of your application, so that you are  able to jump in and fix problems as
they occur.
